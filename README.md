# Demo for the DGUI plugin
A demo of the [DGUI plugin](https://github.com/ebengoechea/de1app_plugin_DGUI) for the [Decent Espresso machine](https://github.com/decentespresso/de1app/).

Enable the plugin, as well as the DGUI and SDB plugins. Restart the app under the Insight skin and tap on the smiley above the godshots heart icon on the bottom right to see the demo page that shows some controls and generic edition pages offered by DGUI. The code contains lots of comments explaining the DGUI "mini-framework".

Then change to the DSx skin and tap on the smiley on the top left to see how the page aspect adapts to the skin without any change in the code.
